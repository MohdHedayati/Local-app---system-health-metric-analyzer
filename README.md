## This is local streamlit APP whose releases will be listed soon

# Collect data from your own system and let our web agents handle the rest !


# Till then me and my mates are working hard to complete the project


*Important notes:*
*1. Before working make sure to set up venv in streamlit_app/streamlit-client directory and install requirements.txt*
*2. Work while keeping the env in mind and do not work with code that assumes a static, pre-determined local db or api call (to something like local host)*
*3. Consult with team members frequently in between changes to ensure everyone is on same page*
