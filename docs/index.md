# System Health AI  
### Intelligent Device Diagnostics Platform

An end-to-end **AI-powered system health monitoring and diagnostics system** combining **desktop system analytics**, **cloud-based intelligence**, **agentic AI**, and **machine learning**.

This platform integrates **local telemetry collection**, **secure cloud synchronization**, **retrieval-augmented reasoning**, and **autonomous AI agents** to deliver **actionable insights into device health, performance, and stability**.

---

## 🚀 Project Scope

This project is a **multi-layered intelligent system** consisting of:

- 🖥 **Local Desktop Application (PyQt5)**  
  Secure system monitoring, hardware telemetry collection, ML inference, and report generation.

- 🌐 **Cloud Web Application (Streamlit)**  
  AI-powered dashboards, chatbot-based diagnostics, report visualization, and analytics.

- 🧠 **AI + Agentic Systems**  
  Generative LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and agent-based reasoning for intelligent diagnostics.

- 📊 **Machine Learning Pipeline**  
  Neural networks and encoders for system health trend analysis and predictive insights.

- ☁ **Backend Infrastructure**  
  Supabase-powered cloud backend with full CRUD support, authentication mapping, and vector storage.
