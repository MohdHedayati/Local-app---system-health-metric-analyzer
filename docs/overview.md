# Project Overview

System Health AI is a **full-stack intelligent diagnostics platform** designed to analyze, understand, and predict system behavior using **machine learning, generative AI, and autonomous agents**.

Traditional system monitoring tools expose raw performance metrics. While useful, these metrics often fail to explain *why* a problem occurs, *how serious* it is, and *what action* should be taken.

This project bridges that gap by combining **local telemetry analysis**, **cloud-based intelligence**, and **AI-driven reasoning** to deliver **actionable system insights** instead of raw numbers.

## 🔍 What This System Does

The platform continuously collects and analyzes system telemetry such as:

- CPU utilization and frequency  
- Memory usage patterns  
- Disk I/O behavior  
- Network traffic characteristics  
- Thermal sensor data  
- Active process behavior  

These metrics are processed using:

- **Machine learning models** for anomaly detection  
- **Neural encoders** for behavior representation  
- **LLM-based reasoning** for diagnostics  
- **Agentic AI pipelines** for autonomous decision-making

## 🧠 Intelligent Diagnostics Pipeline

The system follows a multi-stage diagnostic pipeline:

1. **Local Telemetry Collection**  
   System metrics are collected securely using `psutil` and platform-specific APIs.

2. **ML-Based Pattern Detection**  
   Neural networks detect short-term anomalies and long-term behavior deviations.

3. **Cloud Synchronization**  
   Encrypted reports are securely uploaded to the backend for long-term analytics.

4. **RAG-Powered Reasoning**  
   LLMs analyze reports using retrieval-augmented context specific to each operating system.

5. **Agentic Intelligence**  
   Autonomous agents generate system insights, mitigation steps, and performance forecasts.

## 🌍 Multi-Platform Design

The system is designed for **cross-platform compatibility**:

- Windows  
- Ubuntu Linux  
- Arch Linux  

Each platform includes **OS-specific telemetry collection, optimization rules, and RAG knowledge bases**.

## 🧩 Modular Architecture

The platform is split into modular layers:

- **Desktop Client** — Data collection, ML inference, encryption, reporting  
- **Backend Services** — Authentication, database, vector storage, API endpoints  
- **Web Dashboard** — Visualization, chatbot interface, analytics  
- **AI Engine** — LLM pipelines, RAG, agent workflows  
- **ML Engine** — Neural classifiers, encoders, anomaly detectors  

This modular design allows independent scaling, development, and testing.
